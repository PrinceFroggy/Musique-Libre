A Youtube/Soundcloud music downloader (cover art too), player & tagger.

Download: Build it yourself!

Disclaimer: 

Above is for experimental use. 

All it does (as of right now) is downloads MP3's with proper name to the Libraries\Documents directory & the coverart. 

Also plays the music from the library.
